##Description

This is a 3-server web infrastructure that is secured, monitored, and serves encrypted traffic.

##Specifics About This Infrastructure
The purpose of the firewalls: The firewall is a security architecture that focuses on blocking maleware and application-layer attacks, along with an Integrated Prevention System (IPS). They set policies to better defend your network and carry out quick assesments to detect invasive or suspicious activity like maleware ans shut it down.
The purpose of the SSL certificate: The SSL certificate is  a protocol that creates an encrypted link between a webserver and a web browser. It contacts your secured website and enables an encrypted connection. it is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and the external network to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) and network sniffers from sniffing the traffic which could expose valuable information.
The purpose of the monitoring clients: The monitoring clients monitor the servers and the external network. They analyse the performance and operations of the servers, measure the overall health, and alert the administrators if the servers are not performing as expected. It automatically tests the accessibility of the servers, measures response time, and alerts for errors such as corrupt/missing files, security vulnerabilities/violations, and many other issues.

##Issues With This Infrastructure
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted.
Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure.
Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem. A setup such as this is not easily scalable.
